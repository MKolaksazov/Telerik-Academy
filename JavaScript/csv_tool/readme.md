https://mkolaksazov.github.io/Telerik-Academy/JavaScript/csv_tool/index.html

1) works with any CSV or TXT file, and can change the data and decimal delimiters based on the file type
  
3) works with the four protocols (OJIP, NPQ1,2,3) of fluorometer FluorPen 110 (PSI, Czech Republic)

4) selects columns and draws graphs of the transient OJIP and NPQ curves (samples appear on the graph in their selection order)

5) calculates the average of the selected columns, giving the new column a new sample name

6) calculates the OJIP and NPQ parameters and draws graphs (first, the appropriate protocol should be selected)

7) can save the calculated columns as a new CSV file

8) implements the graphical library of JavaScript: chart.js
